              </a>
              <p>
                Aerobic exercise is any type of cardiovascular conditioning that
                involves the larger muscles with rhythmic and repetitive
                movements. Aerobic exercises make the heart, lungs, blood
                vessels, and muscles work more efficiently. They also increase
                overall strength and endurance. Aerobic exercise also lifts your
                mood, helps you sleep better.

                Flexibility exercises
              </a>
              <p>
                lexibility exercises, also known as range of motion or
                stretching exercises, improve muscle elasticity and joint range
                of motion. You can expect to feel a comfortable tension when
                doing flexibility exercises, but never pain. Having good
                flexibility can help you perform virtually any movement more
                comfortably, from walking to sitting or bending to lift
                something. Flexibility exercises can also help reduce stress and
                promote relaxation. They also assist in decreasing stiffness and
                postural changes that may sometimes occur afterward.

                Strength exercises, also known as resistance exercises, make the
                muscles work harder by adding weight or resistance to the
                movement. Strength exercises also strengthen bones, improve
                balance, posture, and overall quality of life, as household
                tasks and recreational activities become easier and more
                enjoyable. After breast cancer surgery, strength exercises can
                also help improve muscle balance or strengthen muscles.
